[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Pharkie/arr-stack-ugreennas)](https://github.com/Pharkie/arr-stack-ugreennas/releases)

<img align="right" width="45%" src="docs/images/demo/demo.gif">

A Docker Compose stack for automated media management. Request a show or movie, it downloads and appears in Jellyfin—ready to watch, VPN-protected.

Works on Ugreen, Synology, QNAP, or any Docker host.

## Why "Ultimate"?

- **Everything you need** — Jellyfin (media server), Sonarr (TV), Radarr (movies), Prowlarr (indexers), Bazarr (subtitles), Jellyseerr (requests), qBittorrent (torrents), SABnzbd (Usenet), Pi-hole (ad-blocking DNS for your network), WireGuard (remote access), Cloudflare Tunnel (external access). Easy to add or remove.
- **Flexible** — Plex variant included. Supports 30+ VPN providers (Surfshark, NordVPN, PIA, Mullvad, ProtonVPN, etc.).
- **Step-by-step setup guide** — Not just a docker-compose file in a repo.
- **Privacy by default** — All downloads route through your VPN. No IP leaks.

<summary>Technical features</summary>

- **Local `.lan` domains** — `http://sonarr.lan` instead of port numbers
- **Auto-recovery** — Services restart when VPN reconnects
- **Production healthchecks** — Not just "is the process running?"
- **One-command backup script** — Essential configs to ~13MB
- **Pre-commit hooks** — For contributors: validates secrets, YAML, port conflicts
